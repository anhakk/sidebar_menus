# sidebar_menus
Slideout menus

Two sidebar menus with different approach method:
- Left menu [jQuery fadeIn() and fadeOut() functions with delay function]
- right menu [jQuery CSS manipulation targeting the changes in margin-right property]

Both menus were designed to be responsive while paying attention to wide and narrow screen sizes.
